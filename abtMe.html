                        <h2> Family </h2>
                        <p> I have a pretty big family and I love them all so much.
                            They motivate me every day and help me when I'm feeling
                            down. They will always be the people I turn to because
                            all they've shown is care for me. I am the oldest of three
                            with a younger brother and sister.

                        <h2> Nami </h2>
                        <p> I have a ginger cat named Nami and she is the most adorable
                            of all time. She is 5 months old and I got her on August 1st.
                            She is really spoiled and everyone thinks shes the cutest.
                            I don't know what I would do without her. ALthough she drives
                            me crazy I still love her so much.
